# NOTE

Using Pintos version from Lab3. with thread blocking/unblocking implemented

# TO DO (to get this working before anything else)

## Make processor flags to be able to run pintos on bochs with or without mlfqs flag
 - If pintos is run without the mlfqs flag, it should properly run using the ready_list and no priority scheduling.  

## Create New Tests (what are we testing for?)
 - Read the pintos tests and read Lab tests and create some new ones

## Get idle_thread running separately from all other threads (not in a queue)

## Have threads run except when sleep / blocked
